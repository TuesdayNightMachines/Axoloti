#### Description:
This is a crazy but playable noise and drone synth, generating harsh sound scapes qhich can be used as foreground or background textures in a performance.

It requires a [Korg nanoKONTROL2](https://www.korg.com/us/products/computergear/nanokontrol2/) USB-MIDI controller to work as it is.

more coming soon...
