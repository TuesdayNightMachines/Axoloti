#### Description:
This is a MIDI controller for the [Cyclone Analogic TT-606 Drum Drone](https://www.cyclone-analogic.fr/en/85-drum-drone-tt-606-8606164010378.html), a clone of the Roland TR 606 Drumatix drum machine.

It requires an [Akai Midimix](https://www.akaipro.com/midimix) USB-MIDI controller to work as it is and **you need to set your TT-606's input MIDI channel to _11_** or change the channel in the Axoloti project file (see the comment in there).



Enjoy and let me know if you use this project :)
