#### Description:
This is a MIDI controller for the [Cyclone Analogic TT-606 Drum Drone](https://www.cyclone-analogic.fr/en/85-drum-drone-tt-606-8606164010378.html), a clone of the Roland TR 606 Drumatix drum machine.

It requires an [Akai Midimix](https://www.akaipro.com/midimix) USB-MIDI controller to work as it is
... and **you need to set your TT-606's input MIDI channel to _11_** or change the channel in the Axoloti project file (see the comment in there).

The controller puts most of the TT-606's MIDI inputs at your fingertips:
- Flam time
- Auto fill frequency (OFF, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16)
- Shuffle amount
- Tone, Nuance Amount and Nuance Shape for all instruments (apart form the Toms, which have to share their Nuance parameters here)
- Decay & Instrument selection for Cymbal
- Instrument selection for HiHats

It also has a simple mono audio effect built-in too. Just connect the TT-606 audio out to the Axoloti's input. 

Enjoy and let me know if you use this project :)
