### Axoloti Soothe Synth

Files:
- _TTNM_Soothe_Synth__v04.axp:_ This is the project file for editing in the Axoloti Patcher software
- _start.bin:_ A compiled autostart file containing the synth which you may place in the root of your Axoloti's microSD card to play with it right away

This is an automatically playing, calm ambient soundscape generator. It creates evolving sounds and patterns through various feedback paths.

No user interaction is required, however you may control the following parameters:
- **MIDI Note:** shifts the pitch
- **CC 20:** adjusts the amount of audio feedback, making the whole sound harsher (off by default)
- **CC 25 & 26:** adjust the feedback/mix of the two delays
- **CC 21 & 22:** adjust the time of the two delays (creates crackles when adjusted while feedback/mix is turned up)
- **CC 23:** adjusts the mix of the reverb effect
- **CC27:** adjust the decay of the rever effect

Why those MIDI CC numbers? I used the synth with a Korg nanoKey Studio controller, which had these CC numbers mapped to its encoders like that. Changing the CC numbers is easy though in the Axoloti patch. All modules with MIDI mapings are at the top right with comments.

Enjoy and let me know if you use this synth :)
