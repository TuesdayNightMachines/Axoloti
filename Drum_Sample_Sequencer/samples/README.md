Put those drum sample files on your Axoloti's microSD card in a folder named "samples" in the root directory.

There are four samples to choose from per voice, hence the naming scheme with the first number being the voice number and the second number being the sample number.

E.g. s24.raw is sample 4 of voice 2 ... so 24.
